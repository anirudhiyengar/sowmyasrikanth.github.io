									<i>Solar Energy 84, no. 5 (2010): 807-821</i>
									<font color="green">  In this paper, using Artificial Neural Networks, a practical method to predict the solar irradiance ( up to 24 hrs) is proposed. 
									This is useful in order to design a robust and more effective control algorithm to enable communication in a smart grid.

									<font color="green"> A DC-based open energy system (OES) has been described, to exchange power between houses(nanogrids) in a community.
									Equiped with a dc-dc converter and network controller, and a software layer(for autonomous control),power exchange between houses has been examined to handle distribution of DC power using demand response.
									This concept has been tested on the first three homes in a community in Okinawa.
